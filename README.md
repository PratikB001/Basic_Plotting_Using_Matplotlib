# Data Visualization with Matplotlib
This repository contains a collection of data visualization examples created using Matplotlib, a powerful plotting library in Python. The project demonstrates a variety of plotting techniques to visualize data effectively. Each example showcases different types of plots and charts, providing a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to understand and implement data visualization in their own projects.

## Project Highlights
# Line Plots
  - Simple line plots to visualize trends over time.
  - Multiple lines in a single plot to compare different datasets.
  - Customization options like line styles, markers, and colors.

# Bar Charts
  - Vertical and horizontal bar charts.
  - Grouped and stacked bar charts for comparative analysis.
  - Customization of bar colors, widths, and labels.

# Pie Charts
  - Basic pie charts to show proportions.
  - Exploded pie charts for emphasis on specific sections.
  - Customizing pie chart colors, labels, and starting angles.

# Stack Plots
  - Area plots to display cumulative data over time.
  - Customizing colors and labels for different stacks.

# Fill Between Plots
  - Filling the area between two lines to highlight differences.
  - Customizing the fill color and transparency.

# Histograms
  - Histograms to show the distribution of data.
  - Customizing the number of bins, colors, and edge styles.

# Scatter Plots
  - Scatter plots to visualize relationships between two variables.
  - Customizing marker styles, colors, and sizes.

# Time Series Plots
  - Plotting time series data to show trends over time.
  - Formatting date and time on the x-axis for better readability.

# Real-Time Data Plots
  - Real-time plotting of data for live updates.
  - Implementing animation to update plots dynamically.

# Subplots
  - Creating multiple plots in a single figure for comparative analysis.
  - Customizing layout, spacing, and aspect ratio of subplots.
